/*
* A BigUnsigned object represents a nonnegative integer of size
* limited only by available memory.  A BigUnsigned can be
* created from and converted back to most integral types,
* and many math operations are defined on BigUnsigneds.
*
* The number is stored as a series of blocks in a
* dynamically allocated array.  It is as if the number
* were written digit by digit in base 2 ^ N, **where N is the
* number of bits in an unsigned long.**
*
* The memory-management details that used to be in here have
* been moved into NumberlikeArray, which BigUnsigned now derives from.
* `(NlA)' means that member(s) are declared identically in NumberlikeArray.
* Such members are either redeclared here to make them public or are
* here, commented out, for reference.

	/*
	* BigUnsigned and BigInteger both provide three kinds of operators.
	* Here ``big-integer'' refers to BigInteger or BigUnsigned.
	*
	* (1) Overloaded ``return-by-value'' operators:
	*     +, -, *, /, %, unary -.
	* Big-integer code using these operators looks identical to
	* code using the primitive integer types.  These operators take
	* one or two big-integer inputs and return a big-integer result,
	* which can then be assigned to a BigInteger variable or used
	* in an expression.  Example:
	*     BigInteger a(1), b = 1;
	*     BigInteger c = a + b;
	*
	* (2) Overloaded assignment operators:
	*     +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, ++, --, flipSign.
	* Again, these are used on big integers just like on ints.
	* They take one writable big integer that both provides an
	* operand and receives a result.  The first eight also take
	* a second read-only operand.  Example:
	*     BigInteger a(1), b(1);
	*     a += b;
	*
	* (3) ``Put-here'' operations: `add', `subtract', etc.
	* Using a return-by-value or assignment operator generally involves
	* copy constructions and/or assignments.  The ``put-here'' operations
	* require none, but they are more of a hassle to use.  Most take two
	* read-only operands and save the result in the calling object `*this',
	* whose previous value is ignored.  `divideWithRemainder' is an exception.
	* <<< NOTE >>>: Put-here operations do not return a value: they don't need to!!
	* Examples:
	*     BigInteger a(43), b(7), c, d;
	*     c = a + b;   // Now c == 50.
	*     c.add(a, b); // Same effect but without the two bulk-copies.
	*     c.divideWithRemainder(b, d); // 50 / 7; now d == 7 (quotient) and c == 1 (remainder).
	*     a.add(a, b); // ``Aliased'' calls now do the right thing using a
	*              // temporary copy, but see note on divideWithRemainder.
