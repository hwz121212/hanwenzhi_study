CxImage Linked Libraries
CxImage must be linked with additional libraries in order to read and write some specific file formats. All these libraries are freely available, with source code, documentation and examples. Some of the libraries distributed with CxImage have been patched, or slightly edited, to add features normally not enabled in the standard distributions, or just to avoid too many warnings from the compiler during the compilation, and mainly to ensure that CxImage can be easily linked with all of them without troubles. Here is a list of the libraries linked with CxImage :
